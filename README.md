# MFA-Universal-Notebook
Experimental MFA notebook to generate transcriptions in every supported language

Huge thanks to PixPrucer and HAI-D for making the original notebook and script, I just updated it to the latest MFA version and added a menu to choose any compatible language!

Remember to cut up your samples in smaller bits before uploading them, MFA hates long samples!

Please refer to this:

To check if this notebook will work for your language.
